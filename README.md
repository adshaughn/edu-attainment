# Overview
Our goal in this analysis is to determine which factors have the greatest impact on a person's educational attainment.

More specifically, we are looking at years of education and/or highest degree attained.



# Questions to answer
We're hoping to determine which independent variables have the most effect on our dependent variable, educational attainment.

Put another way, we'd like to uncover which variables have the most predictive power in determining a person's education level.

Some potential variables to look at include:

- parental income
- birth order
- gap between siblings
- age
- retirement
- region/country
- religion / cultural
- gender
- employment
	- age of first job
	- job industry of parents/family
- parental educational attainment



# Potential Resources / Data Sources

- other government sources
- university admissions data
- state-level education data

If necessary we will clean data to ensure compatibility.
